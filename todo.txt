refactor:
> make all square-shaped objects inherit from a square class and all circle-shaped objects from a circle class?
    (could also use that to abstract collision; just overload a 'collide' function so 'collide(circle, rect)' does circle-rect collision etc)

done:
> score counter
> score above destroyed targets
> score multiplier when hitting multiple targets
> auto-reloading dart
> Fix collision
> add walls
> fix collision again
> fix collision.. again.. :(   (bullets get stuck at wall..)
> make different darts collide
> maybe several levels (e.g. one that requires to use wall-bouncing to get around a blocking wall in the middle)
> prevent targets from spawning inside walls
> make particles stick to walls if they hit them (just stop moving and don't let them despawn)



ideas:
    Turn this into a space shooter with moving background and what not and the targets become enemy spaceships
    that shoot u and u got like health and shit and maybe theres a boss fight but u still only shoot that one ball
    and there's like lasers and screen shakes and 8bit music

    Maybe even add different darts; like one that reloads faster / flies faster but disintegrates upon hitting a target

    use dartanalyzer

    consider moving the chargeBar into it's own class
