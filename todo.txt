ideas:
    Turn this into a space shooter with moving background and what not and the targets become enemy spaceships
    that shoot u and u got like health and shit and maybe theres a boss fight but u still only shoot that one ball
    and there's like lasers and screen shakes and 8bit music

    Maybe even add different darts; like one that reloads faster / flies faster but disintegrates upon hitting a target

    use dartanalyzer

    consider moving the chargeBar into it's own class
