> make particle direction depend on angle of impact dart->target instead of just dart direction
> camera shakes
> prevent targets from spawning inside walls
> make particles stick to walls if they hit them (just stop moving and don't let them despawn)
> prevent mid-air darts from getting smaller when a new dart is loaded
> fix crash upon hitting a target in the same moment it disappears (probably dividing by zero somewhere)
> make the window bigger
> add fancy level transition
> make the weapon-thingy movable (so you can shoot darts starting from the middle of the screen or sth)


done:
> score counter
> score above destroyed targets
> score multiplier when hitting multiple targets
> auto-reloading dart
> Fix collision
> add walls
> fix collision again
> fix collision.. again.. :(   (bullets get stuck at wall..)
> make different darts collide
> maybe several levels (e.g. one that requires to use wall-bouncing to get around a blocking wall in the middle)


ideas:
    Turn this into a space shooter with moving background and what not and the targets become enemy spaceships
    that shoot u and u got like health and shit and maybe theres a boss fight but u still only shoot that one ball
    and there's like lasers and screen shakes and 8bit music

    Maybe even add different darts; like one that reloads faster / flies faster but disintegrates upon hitting a target

    use dartanalyzer

    consider moving the chargeBar into it's own class
